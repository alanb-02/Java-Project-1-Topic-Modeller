This project will create a GUI base topic modeller. The purpose of this is to detect whetehr a set of documents are "about" the saem topic or not.

The tool shoulod analyse the words in each document - and decide what the most common words are in each document.

Stop words should be exluded fro the analysis - {the, a, of, he, she, etc....} - http://www.lextek.com/manuals/onix/stopwords1.html .

The basic overlap of the top 10 words in each document should grade the likelihood of it being about the same topic should be produced - 7/10 = 70% means the chance that the same topic is very likely and if 4/10 = 40% then the topics must not be the same.
